            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born the 20<sup>th</sup> of November 2003 at the Cornwall Regional Hospital located in Mt. Salem, St. James. I come from an average family as they would call it currently, I  have one sister and two brothers but only one of my brothers resides with us in Jamaica, I lost my dad to stroke and other underlying illness at a young age in my primary school days of 2013. 
            This lost took a significant hit on my family not only emotionally, but financially as well leaving my mom the sole bread winner of the family. This has motivated me to work hard in school to achieve a lot of things I have today and will continue to achieve in life. There were bad days and good days but my family and I continued and had faith and hope 
            that has always brought us through. <br> <br>

            Throughout my school life I have worked hard achieved a lot of awards for my hard working school, from my primary school days at Corinaldi Avenue Primary School in Montego Bay I have recognised that I am one to lead as I always earn the multiples leadership position leading up to my high school tenure where I was the president of the student council body 
            Herbert Morrison Technical High School. After successfully passing the Grade Six Achievement Test with excellent grades to my future high school, while at Herbert I realised even more that this was the school for me as I would learn so much and develop and learn a lot about myself. <br> <br>
            
            While there I learned so many skills such as welding, electrical installation, and auto mechanics, I never in my life dreamt I would learn these skills and grew a love for them and excelled in them academically. Graduated with 7 CXC’s one of my greatest achievements to date was now ready to purse my degree in mechanical engineering. Unfortunately I was not 
            able to pursue that degree as it would require me moving to another city and boarding university, which would all come at a great cost to my mom. I made the tough decision to pursue another degree offered in my city that would ease financial cost for my family. <br> <br>

            Currently I am pursing a bachelor’s in computer science at the University of Technology’s western campus in my city. Technology is something I am very passionate about from 
            a very young age as I would try to repair any little thing I could around the house until I further grew my skills and love for this skill. This shift in degree pursue has not stop my 
            love for my other skills, I believe it is an improvement and addition to my current skills, once I have finished my degree, I look forward to accomplishing my master’s and             
            doctorate degree in my field of computing. To me, life means love, happiness and freedom. Life means so much but we fail to see it sometimes, my life experiences I have 
            thought me so much I have been through good and bad times, I look at life as the greatest thing on earth and continued to enjoy it to the fullest and have fun. <br> <br>
