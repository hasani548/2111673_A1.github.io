            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Leadership ability </b><br><br>
                    Due to my excellent leadership skills, I can successfully guide a team in accomplishing a task. I can lead the way and <br> 
                    guarantee that no team member is left behind, that their opinions are heard, and that we all do our part. <br><br>

                <li>
                    <b>Communication abilities </b><br><br>
                    Being able to speak well with others and provide the required information to them is one of my talents. I can adjust my <br>
                    communication strategy to fit the different circumstances or target audience that I'm addressing. <br><br>

                <li>
                    <b>Problem-solving skills</b><br><br>
                    This is one of my strongest traits and it enables me to sit and analyze complex problems. I consider myself to be a good problem <br> 
                    solver because I take the time to evaluate and solve the problem. I am able to think critically and to analyze facts to find the <br>
                    best potential solution when appropriate. I'm also a fantastic team player when it comes to problem-solving. <br><br>
